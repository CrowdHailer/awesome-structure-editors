* "Functional" language refers to a statically typed purely functional language.
* Some of these store the code as text files, so they are structural but not projectional

### Blocks Programming Editors

Blocks Programming languages/editors are a specific kind of structural programming editors,
where the code is structured in a manner similar to "lego blocks" supporting "drag and drop" editing.
