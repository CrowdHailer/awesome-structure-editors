# Awesome Structure Editors [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of structural/projectional code editor projects.

Any comments, suggestions? [Let us know!](https://github.com/yairchu/awesome-structure-editors/issues)

## Foreword

Projectional programming is an idea that at least some people think holds a lot of promise, as demonstrated by list, but has not yet proven effective (or at least hasn't broken into the mainstream). By the wealth of past and ongoing projects, it is apparently a difficult problem (or an impossible one), but hopefully some of these projects will succeed in bringing it to the mainstream!

### Concluded projects

### Blocks Programming Editors

Blocks Programming languages/editors are a specific kind of structural programming editors,
where the code is structured in a manner similar to "lego blocks" supporting "drag and drop" editing.
